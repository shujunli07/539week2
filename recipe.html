            <h2>Homemade Ratatouille Recipe</h2>
            <img src="images/Ratatouille-recipe-500x500.jpg" width = "600" alt="Homemade Ratatouille Recipe">

            <p>Honestly, if it weren’t for that Disney movie about the rat, I doubt my kids would have been so eager to try my ratatouille recipe. But once they did, they were delighted and now it’s a dish I love to make when I feel like we should have something meatless.</p> 
            <P>Made with a bounty of fresh, colorful vegetables, you’ll love the garden-fresh flavors in this tasty meal!</P>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <p> 4 tbsp olive oil (divided)
                    4 garlic cloves (minced)
                    1/2 small onion (chopped)
                    1/3 cup carrot (shredded)
                    14 oz crushed tomatoes
                    2 tsp dried basil
                    1/2 tsp dried parsley
                    1 small eggplant (sliced 1/8 inch thick circles)
                    2 small zucchini (sliced 1/8 inch thick circles)
                    3 Roma tomatoes (sliced 1/8 inch thick circles)
                    salt (to taste)
                    black pepper (to taste)</p>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 375F. In a large nonstick pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium high heat. Add in the onion, garlic, and carrot and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Next, add in the crushed tomatoes and seasonings and simmer for 15 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Once the sauce has thickened, pour into a 2 quart baking dish. Arrange the sliced vegetables in a circular pattern standing upright in the dish over the sauce. Brush with the remaining olive oil. Cover and bake for 30 minutes, then uncover and bake until vegetables are tender. Serve immediately.</p>

            <h2>Basic Crêpes</h2>
            <img src="images/crepes-index-64347419e3c7a.jpg" width = "600" alt="Basic Crêpes">
            <p>Crêpes can be filled with all sorts of tasty things—fresh fruit and whipped cream, leftover ham and cheese, roasted vegetables—but a truly excellent crêpe can be eaten straight out of the pan, all on its own.</p> 
            <P>With that in mind, we’ve fine-tuned this recipe to yield crêpes that are buttery and just sweet enough to caramelize lightly in the pan. </P>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <p>     2 large eggs, room temperature1 1/4 c.
                    whole milk, room temperature1 c.(120 g.) all-purpose flour
                    4 tsp.
                    granulated sugar
                    1/2 tsp. kosher salt
                    3 tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, cooled, plus 1/2 tsp. cold unsalted butter
                    Fresh berries and powdered sugar, for serving (optional)</p>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Step 1In a blender, blend eggs, milk, flour, granulated sugar, salt, and 3 tablespoons melted butter until smooth, about 1 minute. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.
                    Step 2Preheat a 9" nonstick skillet over medium heat. Melt 1/2 teaspoon cold butter in preheated pan. Reduce heat to medium-low. Briefly whisk batter, then pour 1/4 cup into center of pan, lifting pan off heat and slightly tilting in a circular motion to help batter spread into an even circle. Cook until top is set and bottom is golden brown, about 45 seconds. Flip and cook on second side until cooked through, about 45 seconds more.
                    Step 3Using a spatula, fold crêpe into quarters. Transfer to plate. Repeat with remaining batter for a total of 8 crêpes.
                    Step 4Serve with berries and powdered sugar, if desired.
                    Step 5Make Ahead: Crêpes can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool, then stack between sheets of parchment, store in an airtight container, and refrigerate, or freeze up to 1 month. </p>
